# more-android-examples

A GitHub repository collecting Android examples. For more information check project website at [http://androidco.de](http://androidco.de).

## Base Project

Ignore this one since it nothing more than a basic Android Eclipse project. This is used for creating new examples only. 

## Actionbar Compat & Menu Drawer

Example based on the official Android ActionBar example but now implemented with the actionbar compat implementation and a menu drawer added. This is how to use the menu drawer (aka sliding menu) and actionbar on 2.1 and up devices the right way.

## Fragment Based Navigation

Example coming soon.

## Android Camera Preview 

This is a fork of mine of an already nice project with the required API checks in code and fallbacks for missing parameters. Check the original example if you need the tags to go through the different steps of preview configuration.
